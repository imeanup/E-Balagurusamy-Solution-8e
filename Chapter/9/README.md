Amazon Review based on my progress.

I would not recommend this book due to the following:

1. As you progress through the chapter, the programming code does not advance. For example, the code uses 'cout &lt;&lt; "\n";' multiple times, which does not encourage the use of C++'s specific 'std'.

2. There are spelling mistakes present in the code output and comments.

3. I am concerned about the lack of organization and clarity in the programming exercises. The author did not put any effort into building the exercises, and although new exercises were added to the new edition, they were not accompanied by any solutions.

4. At the beginning of the textbook, there is a WEB icon with the statement "For further assistance, students can also refer to the website for solutions to questions containing the WEB icon." However, after struggling for a week, I contacted the support and was able to download the student content available for free on the McGraw Hill website. Unfortunately, the content did not have any solutions to the questions. Therefore, students should be aware before purchasing the textbook.

5. The publisher and author did not put any effort into modifying the code or specifying which compiler it should run on and what standard it should adhere to. For example, on Page 252, Program 9.5, the code states 'char *ptr[10]', but if you do a dry run, you will find an error, as it should be 'const char *ptr[10]'. Therefore, no effort was made to update the code to the latest standard.

6. Chapter 9, Pointers, Page 254 states "The function pointer cannot be dereferenced". However, in the code of Program 9.7, the function dereference operator '&' is used with the function 'Add'. The moral of the story is to be cautious while reading and cross-checking with Microsoft and CPP reference when facing any difficulties. Chapter 9 on Pointers is not well written and lacks explanations, such as the 'this' pointer, which the author was unable to explain and instead added something non-related to the important concept..

I will update this review with additional points as I read through the book. Additionally, I referred to "Lafore" for Chapter 9 on the this pointer, and you will find some differences between the two textbooks.

This is NOT the END. I just starting LATE.
