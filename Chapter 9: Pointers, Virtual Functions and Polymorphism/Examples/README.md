Chapter 9, Pointers, Page 254 states "The function pointer cannot be dereferenced". However, in the code of Program 9.7, the function dereference operator '&' is used with the function 'Add'. 

The moral of the story is to be cautious while reading and cross-checking with Microsoft and CPP reference when facing any difficulties. Chapter 9 on Pointers is not well written and lacks explanations, such as the 'this' pointer, which the author was unable to explain and instead added something non-related to the important concept.
