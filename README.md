This project is a collection of programming exercises based on the concepts covered in the book "Object Oriented Programming in C++" by E Balagurusamy. The exercises cover a range of topics, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and exception handling.

Each exercise is designed to help readers understand and apply the concepts covered in the book. The exercises are designed to be challenging but achievable, and are structured to help readers progressively build their programming skills.

The project is open-source and welcomes contributions from the community. Contributors are encouraged to add their own exercises or to modify existing ones to improve the overall quality of the project.

By completing these programming exercises, readers will gain a deeper understanding of the concepts covered in the book and develop their programming skills in C++. This project is an excellent resource for students, educators, and professionals who want to learn and practice object-oriented programming in C++.
